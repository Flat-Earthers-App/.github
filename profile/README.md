# üåç Flat Earthers App

An interactive, web-based application designed to facilitate the comparison of ground-based observations with Landsat data. The Flat Earthers App allows users to define target locations, receive notifications when a Landsat satellite is passing over the specified area, and access and visualize corresponding Landsat Surface Reflectance (SR) data.

## üöÄ Project Overview
The Flat Earthers App was developed as part of the NASA's 2024 International Space Apps Landsat Challenge. Our tool addresses the challenge of integrating satellite data with ground-level observations by providing a user-friendly platform that combines geolocation, data acquisition, and visualization.

### Key Features:
- **Location Definition and Selection:** Allows users to specify a location using latitude, longitude, or an interactive map.
- **Landsat Satellite Overpass Detection:** Notifies users when a Landsat satellite is passing over the target location.
- **Data Visualization:** Displays a 3x3 grid of Landsat pixels centered on the user's location and provides SR data analysis.
- **Cloud Coverage Filtering:** Users can set thresholds for cloud coverage to receive accurate data.
- **Downloadable Data:** All data can be exported in CSV format for further analysis.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Enable satellite data integration with ground-based observations.**
- **Enhance data accessibility and user interaction for various research needs.**
- **Provide seamless notifications for efficient data collection.**

## üì¶ Installation and Setup

**Follow the readme files on the Frontend and Backend repos of this organization.**

## Future this goals
If this project is to continued and improved in the future, a chatbox and a mobile app will be developed to enhance accessibility for the target users.
