# 🌍 Flat Earthers App

An interactive, web-based application designed to facilitate the comparison of ground-based observations with Landsat data. The Flat Earthers App allows users to define target locations, receive notifications when a Landsat satellite is passing over the specified area, and access and visualize corresponding Landsat Surface Reflectance (SR) data.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Flat Earthers App was developed as part of the NASA's 2024 International Space Apps Landsat Challenge. Our tool addresses the challenge of integrating satellite data with ground-level observations by providing a user-friendly platform that combines geolocation, data acquisition, and visualization.

### Key Features:
- **Location Definition and Selection:** Allows users to specify a location using latitude, longitude, or an interactive map.
- **Landsat Satellite Overpass Detection:** Notifies users when a Landsat satellite is passing over the target location.
- **Data Visualization:** Displays a 3x3 grid of Landsat pixels centered on the user's location and provides SR data analysis.
- **Cloud Coverage Filtering:** Users can set thresholds for cloud coverage to receive accurate data.
- **Downloadable Data:** All data can be exported in CSV format for further analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Enable satellite data integration with ground-based observations.**
- **Enhance data accessibility and user interaction for various research needs.**
- **Provide seamless notifications for efficient data collection.**

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Web API
- **Mapping Tool:** Google Maps API
